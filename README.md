# Building event-driven multi-account activity monitoring solutions

![](./logo.png)

In this webinar, we'll discuss how to effectively implement real-time, multi-account activity monitoring. You'll learn how organizations are moving beyond traditional polling methods to adopt modern event-driven architectures that can effectively monitor thousands of AWS accounts. Experts from AWS and CrowdStrike will share the latest strategies and provide real-world insights from their experience implementing these solutions at scale.

In this session, youâ€™ll learn:

* Traditional polling-based approach limits
* Evolving to push-based systems with event-driven architectures
* Using CloudTrail and EventBridge for real-time activity monitoring and automated response
* Designing cost-effective and efficient cross-account data transport mechanisms
* Building resilient data pipelines that can handle enterprise-scale events volume
* Best practices for filtering, classification, and priority-based processing

Join us to learn about modern methodologies of multi-account activity monitoring from industry leaders. Whether you're an AppSec team leader, cloud security professional, or solution architect, you'll gain practical knowledge for enhancing your organization's cloud security posture.
